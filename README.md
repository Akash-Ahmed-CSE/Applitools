# 🔍 Visual UI Testing with Applitools and Selenium

This project demonstrates how to use **Applitools Eyes** for visual UI testing along with **Selenium WebDriver** and **TestNG**. The test automates a registration form on [demo.automationtesting.in](https://demo.automationtesting.in/Register.html), capturing visual checkpoints before and after form interactions.
